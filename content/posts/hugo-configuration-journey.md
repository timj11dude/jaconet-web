# Birth of tim.jaconet.uk
_with hugo_

When looking to create a website, I had in mind something simple, effortless and cheap to host.
I've maintained my share of corporate internal websites with Vue.js, JSF, and React.
However, I prefer to consider myself more suited to background engineering work,
as I do not have the artistic eye (or particular care) for designing my own website beyond a template.

I also knew I did not want to maintain any HTML or CSS files myself, as I did years ago,
as the experience is cumbersome and less transparent than that of a simple Markdown document.

The part of my requirements is minimal costs to host, 
with the potential someday of posting the site on a decentralized platform like [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/).

Static site generation becomes the obvious solution here then, 
where no server side rendering is required, only the accessibility of the generated files,
any theme, animation, or dynamic content is handled on the client side.
Perfect for a website like mine, as I do not intent on publishing such content,
at least in the short term.

This website is made using Hugo and hosted on GitHub pages, and so far I am satisfied with the experience.

One hurdle encountered is the mix-content being served sometimes causes the site not to render properly.

I intend to use the site to document my progress as a professional Software Engineer,
with what technologies I am using, experiences, tips, and other items in the sphere of software technology.
